# Home Assistant Custom Component for Rooted Toon Smoke Sensors

This is a Custom Component for Home-Assistant (https://home-assistant.io) reads and displays sensor values from the smoke sensors connected to a rooted Toon thermostat.

The Custom Component is a modified version of the smart meter sensor component created by cyberjunky (https://github.com/cyberjunky/home-assistant-toon_smartmeter)

NOTE: This component only works with rooted Toon devices. Toon thermostats are available in The Netherlands and Belgium (as Boxx).
